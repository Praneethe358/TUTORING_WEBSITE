## **Step 2: Set Up Google Search Console (CRITICAL)**

### **Why This Matters**
Google Search Console is **essential** for:

- Requesting immediate indexing

### **Setup Steps:**

```

**To Complete Verification:**
1. In Google Search Console, choose "**HTML tag**" verification method

4. If the code doesn't match, let me know and I'll update it
